NAME
       tcpdumpd - run tcpdump in background with multiple configurations.


SYNOPSIS
       tcpdumpd [COMMAND] <PARAMETERS>


DESCRIPTION
       Logs  network  packets  to rotating file ring while silently running in
       the background. Command line utility and 'daemon' wrapper for  tcpdump.
       Supports multiple configurations and instances.


OPTIONS
   [COMMANDS]
       start  Starts the daemon process.


       stop   Stops the daemon process.


       status Checks  for running tcpdumpd processes. Accepts a single pidfile
              (absolute path or job name, see '-j', -p, -r) to check it's staâ€
              tus.


       setup  Recall install script to change general program options.


   <PARAMETERS>
       -c, --configpath /path/to/config.file
              Absolute path and filename for custom config file.


       -r, --ringfile filename.file
              Base  name  (suffix)  for a new ringfile. Existing files will be
              overwritten.


       -p, --pidfile /path/to/pidfile.file
              Absolute path and name of PID file for the new instance.


       -n, --numberofringfiles int
              How many ringfiles to create.


       -s, --size int
              Size of each ringfile in millions of bytes. Integer.


       -f, --filter 'quoted expression'
              Additional custom filter or  options  for  tcpdump.  Must  be  a
              quoted string. See  man pcap-savefile (5) .


       -v, --verbosity 'tcpdump_verbosity_param'
              Toggle  verbosity. Must be a quoted string ('-v', '-vv', '-vvv',
              see tcpdump(1))


       -j, --job jobname
              Shorthand to create pidfile  and  ringfiles  with  corresponding
              names.  If  a file 'jobname' and suffix 'conf' is present in the
              program dir ($myinstalldir) this one will be used instead of the
              default  config  file.  Do *not* use in conjunction with '-r' or
              '-p' options.


   Example usage
       tcpdumpd start
              Start the configured tcpdumpd until stopped by 'tcpdumpd stop'.


       tcpdumpd start -p my.pid -r newdmp- -f 'not host my.net'
              Use standard config for  a  new  tcpdumpd  logging  to  filering
              'newdmp-*'  and do not log packets to and from host.net. Process
              information is in my.pid.


       tcpdumpd start -j mynewjob -s 50
              Will  create  a  filering   of   'mynewjob*'   and   a   pidfile
              'mynewjob.pid',  using  default values from config. Each file in
              the  ring  will  have  a  size  of  fifty  million   bytes.   If
              'mynewjob.conf'  is present in '$myinstalldir' it will be evaluâ€
              ated.


       tcpdumpd stop mynewjob
              Stop the process from 'mynewjob' and/or delete  it.  Usefull  if
              tcpdumpd terminated irregulary and does not restart the job.

       ported yet.
