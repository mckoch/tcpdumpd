Command line utility and 'daemon' wrapper for  tcpdump. Supports multiple configurations and instances.\r\n\r\n## tcpdumpd v0.21\r\n\r\nWrapper and control script for tcpdump which makes it easy to log network packets in the background to a file ring. tcpdump allows multiple configurations and instances for simultaneous logging to several file rings. By default, one tcpdumpd instance is started at boot time as a permanent short time logging service. \r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n      $> tcpdumpd (start|status|stop|restart|setup) < -param val >\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nA linux box, some knowledge about tcpdump, ssh root access.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n1. Unzip/untar the archive in a safe place\r\n2. chdir there.\r\n3. Run ./tcpdump-setup.sh as root.\r\n4. Answer 'yes' for default installation.\r\n\r\n### Changing install configuration\r\n\r\nTo change the setup values, edit starttcpdump.cfg. To install to a different program directory, you will have to edit the file tcpdumpd too.  First line:\r\n\r\n\t    myinstallpath=\"/root/scripts/tcpdumpd/\"    \r\n\r\n## Post install\r\n\r\n\t$> man tcpdumpd'.\r\n1. Adjust the defaults for size and number of ring files to the size and traffic of the box.\r\n\r\n\t \t#number of logfiles before overwritimg\r\n\t    tcpdump_FILECOUNT=\"-W 3\"\r\n\t    # int max filesize in millions of bytes \r\n\t\ttcpdump_FILESIZE=\"-C 1\" \r\n\r\n2. Adjust the filter, except you want to log everything.\r\n\r\n\t    # tcpdump verbosity optipns: -v -vv -vvv\r\n\t    tcpdump_VERBOSITY=\" -v -n \"\r\n\t    # tcpdump filter, i.e. ' -i eth0 -p udp host 1.2.3.4 \"\r\n\t    tcpdump_FILTER=\" not host localhost \"\t\r\n\r\n\r\n### Uninstall\r\n\r\nThe installer script will overwrite its default files from a previous installation. It will not touch any files generated during runtime (logs, configs). \r\n\r\n0. Stop all running instances.\r\n1. Run 'tcdumpd setup' or\r\n2. Chdir to the program directory (which is /usr/local/tcpdumpd by default) and run './tcpdumpd setup' as root.\r\n3. 'no' if setup asks if tcpdumpd shall start at system boot.\r\n4. 'no' if setup asks for creating a link in /sbin.\r\n5. You may 'ctrl-c' afterwards to exit setup.\r\n6. Manually delete /usr/local/tcpdumpd and /var/log/tcpdumpd\r\n\r\n## Important\r\n\r\n\r\nThis program is NOT designed to run in user space. It is NOT a good idea to add users to tcpdumpd's group since this would be a massive break of privacy in a shared environment, at least. Last, it is absolutely NO good idea to let tcpdumpd run as user or in group 'root'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bugs\r\nThis script is tested in Debian 4, 5 and 6, even if 'update-rc.d' may complain during setup This will be fixed with a future (hopefully) dpkg release.
